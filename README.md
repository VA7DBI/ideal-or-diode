# Ideal OR Diode

In realms where reliability reigns supreme,
Systems of high avail strive to dream,
With power supplies redundant and true,
Bolstering reliability, ensuring they pursue.

Tradition has seen diodes stand tall,
Linked with capacitors to answer the call,
Yet, in their shadow, a drawback doth lie,
With voltage drop, power loss doth vie.

Enter now, with grace and might,
A solution born of innovation's light,
An N-channel MOSFET, a hero untold,
Bringing forth efficiency, breaking the mold.

Activated in power's fervent dance,
It shuns the loss, it takes its chance,
With low voltage drop, it carries the load,
Matching ideals, along wisdom's road.

Thus, in the realm where technology thrives,
Poetry meets innovation, where beauty thrives,
In systems of power, reliability finds its place,
A tale of progress, a poetic grace.


## Summary

This Ideal OR Diode circuit is designed to protect a 12V nominal (5-15) supply at 50A.
